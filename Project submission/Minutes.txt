Group 1 members: Erik Anderberg, Ivo Urbanczyk, Lincoln Tut, Jackson Bamber, Jonathan Mak


Minutes: 
-----------------------------
Session 1 (26/4-22, Tron Lab)
Present: All
Agenda:
Spent the lab discussing and brainstorming prototype ideas.

-----------------------------
Session 2 (1/5-22, Discord)
Present: All
Agenda: To delegate tasks in the project and begin understanding PTU module 
Decided on project idea and assigned partial tasks;
  User interface - Erik
  LIDAR sensor info to distance - Ivo
  Controlling/Checking LIDAR orientation - Lincoln
  Logic for LIDAR movement - Jonathan and Jackson

-----------------------------
Session 3 (3/5, Tron Lab)
Present: All
Agenda: To brainstorm
We had not received a PTU yet so progress was limited, idea was developed and further delegation of parts occurred. 
-----------------------------
Session 4 (15/5-22, Discord)
Present: Erik, Jonathan, Jackson
Agenda: To complete progress report and discuss plans for integration
Completed a progress check and what else needs to be done
Completed the progress report for week 12 submission

-----------------------------

Session 5 (18/5-22, Engineering building)
Present: Lincoln, Ivo
Agenda: Attempt to fix some bugs causing code to not compile
Incorporating Jackson’s serial code into the main project and debugging. Realised that our Dragon Board code doesn’t compile. We have no idea why. (Some kind of syntax error?)

-----------------------------

Session 6 (19/5-22, Engineering building)
Present: Erik, Ivo
Agenda: To test that serial communication between codewarrior and python modules can occur
Finally fixed syntax error in Dragon Board code. Testing and further debugging transmission of data from board to python. Erik’s code is working as intended, all we need to do is fix all the undefined behaviour of the Dragon Board.

-----------------------------
Session 7 (22/5-22, Engineering building)
Present: All
Agenda: To further each module separately and debug
Worked on plotting point cloud and box depth finding algorithm with randomised test data, further debugging and incorporation of modules.

-----------------------------
Session 8 (23/5-22, Engineering building)
Present: All
Agenda: Get Dragon Board to successfully send point data
We changed from trying to send serial data in struct format to serialising data in ASCII format. Finally successfully communicated real point data from lidar to matlab point cloud plotting code. The video was created and documentation was completed

-----------------------------
Session 9 (24/5/22, Engineering Building)
Present: All
Agenda: To assure that project is demonstration ready, with all code/documentation is submitted on git and video uploaded to canvas
We trialled presenting the project, and did final changes such as cleaning the git repository
